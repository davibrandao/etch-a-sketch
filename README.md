# Etch a Sketch - Davi Brandao

This is a simple project that creates an interactive Etch Sketch-style grid using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a webpage with a dynamic grid of square divs. The divs are generated using JavaScript, avoiding manual copying and pasting in the HTML file. The squares are contained within a "container" div, and the appearance of the divs is styled as a grid using CSS Flexbox.

## Features

- Interactive grid of squares with a hover effect.
- The grid squares change color on mouse hover, simulating a pen-like drawing effect.
- A button at the top of the screen allows users to input the number of squares per side for a new grid.
- The existing grid is replaced with a new grid of the specified size while maintaining the total space.
- User input is limited to a maximum of 64 squares per side to prevent performance issues.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Hover your mouse over the squares to see the drawing effect.
4. Click the button at the top to generate a new grid with a specified number of squares per side.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the grid not being created or other unexpected behavior, consider the following steps:

- Check if the CSS stylesheet is linked correctly.
- Open your browser's developer tools and inspect the console for errors.
- Verify if the elements are in the "elements" pane but hidden.
- Use `console.log` statements in your JavaScript to debug.

## Future Enhancements

- Explore different color options for the hover effect.
- Add additional interaction features to the grid.
- Implement more advanced drawing tools and options.
